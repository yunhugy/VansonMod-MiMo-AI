## Introduction

**VansonMod** is an independent iOS debugging tool built for the **TrollStore** environment. It works externally instead of relying on traditional tweak injection, so many common workflows remain available on non-jailbroken devices, including process selection, memory search, memory browsing, pointer analysis and verification, signature analysis, scripting, and app archive management.

On jailbroken devices, VansonMod unlocks deeper code-level workflows such as **RVA patching** and **hardware watchpoint monitoring**. The current version has grown from a pure memory search utility into a broader iOS debugging workstation for both iPhone and iPad, with support for split view, landscape, and Stage Manager.

## Compatibility Notes

- **Available on TrollStore / non-jailbroken devices**: process selection, memory search, nearby search, result filtering, memory browsing, Hex editor, pointer analysis and verification, signature analysis, script tools, app archive management, and theme/language/icon settings.
- **Features that depend on the target task port**: some runtime features require successful access to the target process task port, so actual behavior can vary depending on the environment and target app state.
- **Recommended or limited to jailbroken environments**: `RVA Patch`, `RVA record management`, and `hardware watchpoint monitoring` are best used in **Dopamine / palera1n** style jailbreak environments.
- **Why**: on non-jailbroken devices, **AMFI** strictly enforces code-signing checks. Directly modifying the executable text segment (`__TEXT`) will usually crash the target app immediately.

## Language Support

- Built-in languages: 简体中文, 繁體中文, English, العربية, Deutsch, Español, Français, 日本語, 한국어, Português, Русский, ไทย, Tiếng Việt.

## Navigation

- **App Selection**: browse running processes, all installed apps, or system processes; search by name / Bundle ID / PID; quickly attach, open, kill, back up, or inspect code changes for a target app.
- **Memory Debug**: perform exact, fuzzy, group, and nearby searches, filter results, batch edit values, and jump into value or Hex views.
- **RVA Debug**: patch by module and offset, manage saved RVA records, and handle deeper code-level workflows in jailbreak environments.
- **Toolbox**: manage memory locks, favorites, pointers, RVA records, signatures, verifier files, and scripts in one place.
- **Settings**: configure theme, language, icons, tab order, search ranges, float tolerance, result limits, update checks, and more, with quick tab reordering by long-pressing the bottom menu.

## Highlights

- **Process and App Management**: supports `Running / All / System` views, localized app names, version display, starring, PID / Bundle ID copying, quick app launch, and process termination.
- **Memory Search and Batch Editing**: supports exact, fuzzy, group, range, and nearby search modes, plus greater-than / less-than / between filters, fixed value writes, incremental edits, batch lock, batch favorite, and batch delete.
- **Memory Browser and Hex Editor**: supports address jumping, auto refresh, string view, and batch address copying; the Hex editor supports `Hex / Split / Text` layouts, row editing, offset jumps, and fast writes.
- **Pointer Analysis and Verification**: supports manual and automatic pointer chains, static / dynamic / all / backtrack modes, real-time verification, incremental snapshots, changed-region comparison, verifier file save/import/export, and lock integration.
- **Signature Analysis**: jump into signature analysis from any address, choose module scope, run global searches, apply smart masking, verify matches, and save signatures directly into the toolbox.
- **Script System**: includes a built-in JavaScript runtime with examples, shortcuts, and console output; script guides and examples can be viewed directly inside VM to help users get started faster.
- **RVA Debugging and Watchpoint Monitor**: supports module selection, offset patching, ARM64 instruction presets, and RVA record management; in jailbreak environments it also provides hardware watchpoint monitoring, hit records, a code inspector, and quick sending of hit locations into the RVA debugger.
- **App Archives and Process Audit**: supports one-tap backup and restore for `Documents / Library`, multiple archives, and Files app import/export; process audit helps you see which code locations or RVA values changed before and after the target app runs, with diff export and original-byte restore.
- **Settings and UX Improvements**: supports theme switching, language switching, app icon switching, tab reordering, quick tab reordering by long-pressing the bottom menu, fuzzy search range control, lock interval, prevent sleep, result limits, update checks, and native iPad split view, landscape, and Stage Manager support.
